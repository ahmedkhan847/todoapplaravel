## ToDo application With User Authentication

A todo application created on Laravel 5.4 along with user authentication. This is the repo for the following tutorial series which I published on Cloudways.

* [CREATING TODO APPLICATION IN LARAVEL 5.4: MIGRATING TABLE, CREATING CONTROLLERS & MODELS](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/laravel-5-4-todo-app-setting-authentication-functionality/)
* [LARAVEL 5.4 TODO APP: SETTING AUTHENTICATION AND TODO FUNCTIONALITY](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/laravel-5-4-todo-app-setting-authentication-functionality/)
* [Introduction to Laravel Dusk: Testing Todo App](http://www.cloudways.com/blog/laravel-dusk-testing-todo-app/)

## Update

Laravel Passport support has been also added in it. Now you can use it for your API too.
